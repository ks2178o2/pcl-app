NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION
=========================

COMPLETED MODULES (95%+ TARGET):
=================================
✅ Permissions Middleware: 97.83%
✅ Context Manager: 95.93%
✅ Audit Service: 96.89%
🟡 Tenant Isolation: 90.05% (excellent, but not quite 95%)

REMAINING WORK - PRIORITY ORDER:
=================================

NEXT TARGET: Enhanced Context Manager (25.86% → 95%)
Need: +69.14% coverage
Lines: 276 statements
Missing: 196 lines + 8 branches

Why Next:
- Substantial codebase (276 lines)
- Core functionality for context management
- Has 25.86% already (starting point exists)
- Similar complexity to modules we've already tackled
- Important for RAG/context features

THEN:
2. Supabase Client: 35.63% → 95% (need +59.37%)
   - Infrastructure layer
   - Smaller codebase (73 lines)
   - Important for database operations

3. Feature Inheritance Service: 0% → 95%
4. Validation Middleware: 0% → 95%
5. All 4 API modules: 0% → 95%

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
=====================
Continue systematically through the services layer:
1. Enhanced Context Manager (next)
2. Supabase Client
3. Feature Inheritance Service
4. Then API modules
5. Finally Validation Middleware

This follows the same successful pattern we used for
Permissions, Context Manager, Audit Service, and Tenant Isolation.
