# Application Updates Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

All critical application code updates have been implemented to support the new center-based hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ User Creation - Multiple Center Support

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/realtime-gateway/src/hooks/useSystemAdmin.ts`
- `apps/realtime-gateway/src/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated `CreateUserData` interface to use `center_ids?: string[]` (array) instead of `center_id?: string`
- Modified `createUserWithRoles` to create multiple `user_assignments` records for selected centers
- Updated `UserManagement` component to pass all selected center IDs

**Result**: Users can now be assigned to multiple centers when created by admins.

### 2. ‚úÖ Patient Creation - Center Assignment

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/realtime-gateway/src/hooks/usePatients.ts`
- `apps/realtime-gateway/src/components/PatientSelector.tsx`
- `apps/realtime-gateway/src/components/PatientInput.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `center_id?: string` to `CreatePatientData` interface
- Modified `createPatient` to accept and set `center_id` when inserting patients
- Updated both `PatientSelector` and `PatientInput` to use `useCenterSession` hook
- Automatically assigns new patients to the user's active center

**Result**: New patients are automatically assigned to the center the user is currently working with.

### 3. ‚úÖ RLS Policies - Center-Based Security

**Files Created**:
- `UPDATE_RLS_POLICIES_FOR_CENTER_HIERARCHY.sql`

**Status**: Ready to run in Supabase SQL Editor

**What it does**:
- Drops old organization-based policies
- Creates new center-based policies that:
  - Grant access to patients based on center assignments
  - Include fallback for users without center assignments (see all org patients)
  - Maintain organization-level safety checks

**Result**: Row-level security now respects center assignments.

### 4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Edit User Dialog - Multiple Centers

**Status**: Deferred

**Note**: `EditUserDialog` currently only supports single center selection. This was intentionally deferred as it's lower priority. The admin can create users with multiple centers, and existing users can be edited with a new single center assignment.

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test the following:

### User Management
- [ ] Create a user with 1 center assignment
- [ ] Create a user with multiple center assignments
- [ ] Create a user with region assignment
- [ ] Create a user without center/region (org-wide access)
- [ ] Verify `user_assignments` table has correct records

### Patient Management
- [ ] Create a patient with an active center selected
- [ ] Create a patient without a center selected
- [ ] Verify `center_id` is set correctly in `patients` table
- [ ] Search for patients and verify RLS is working
- [ ] Verify users only see patients from their assigned centers

### RLS Policies
- [ ] Run `UPDATE_RLS_POLICIES_FOR_CENTER_HIERARCHY.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify new policies exist: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'patients'`
- [ ] Test with user assigned to 1 center
- [ ] Test with user assigned to multiple centers
- [ ] Test with user without center assignments

### Call Records
- [ ] Create a call record with an active center
- [ ] Verify `center_id` is set in `call_records` table
- [ ] Filter calls by center

### Center Session
- [ ] User with multiple centers sees center selection modal
- [ ] User with 1 center automatically selects it
- [ ] User with no assignments sees all centers in their org
- [ ] Switching centers works correctly

## Database Scripts to Run

**Priority 1 - Required**:
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE_RLS_POLICIES_FOR_CENTER_HIERARCHY.sql
```

**Priority 2 - Verify Current State**:
```bash
# Run first to check current policies
CHECK_CURRENT_RLS_POLICIES.sql

# Run after UPDATE_RLS to verify changes
CHECK_CURRENT_RLS_POLICIES.sql
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after running RLS updates:

1. Revert to organization-based policies by running:
```sql
-- Copy old policies from COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql or create_patients_table.sql
```

2. Application code changes are non-breaking:
   - Added optional `center_id` to patient creation (backward compatible)
   - Changed `center_id` to `center_ids` for user creation (breaking for admins only, they'll see type errors)

3. Database data is unaffected by code changes

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Run RLS Update Script** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. üß™ **Test All Functionality** using checklist above
3. üìä **Monitor Application** for any issues
4. üîÑ **Optional**: Enhance EditUserDialog to support multiple centers
5. üéØ **Optional**: Add center filtering to patient lists
6. üìà **Optional**: Use new database views for reporting

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
2. Verify foreign key constraints are working
3. Check that all users have valid `organization_id` in profiles
4. Verify `user_assignments` table has correct data
5. Review `DATABASE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for schema reference
