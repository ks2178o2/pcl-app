CURRENT WORK STATUS
===================

WHAT I'M WORKING ON:
===================
Pushing Audit Service from 83.56% → 95% (+11.44% needed)
Then: Tenant Isolation from 70.16% → 95% (+24.84% needed)

PROGRESS:
=========
✅ Audit Service: 83.56% (improved from 83.11%)
   - Added 3 new tests
   - Total tests: 26 passing
   - Missing: Branch conditions, complex query chains
   
CURRENT COVERAGE BREAKDOWN:
===========================
✅ Permissions Middleware: 97.83% (COMPLETE)
✅ Context Manager: 95.93% (COMPLETE)
🟡 Audit Service: 83.56% (11.44% to go)
🟡 Tenant Isolation: 70.16% (24.84% to go)

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Add tests for remaining Audit Service branches
2. Focus on lines: 62, 78 (action filters), error paths
3. Move to Tenant Isolation once Audit hits 95%

CHALLENGES:
===========
- Complex Supabase query chains are hard to mock
- Missing branches involve 3-4 level .eq() chaining
- Error paths require specific exception triggers
- Branch coverage harder to reach than statement coverage

WORKING ON: Auditing complex query paths to identify testable paths...
