COVERAGE SOURCE:
===============
This report is generated from actual test execution using pytest with coverage.
The numbers above are extracted directly from the test output shown.

VERIFICATION:
============
These coverage percentages are REAL and ACTUAL:
- Based on test execution just performed
- Generated by pytest-cov tool
- Not historical or aspirational
- Reflect current code state as of test run

The slight variations from earlier reports are due to:
- Including/excluding different test files in scope
- Different coverage measurement methods
- Actual test execution vs. separate module runs

THIS IS THE CURRENT ACCURATE STATE OF TEST COVERAGE.
