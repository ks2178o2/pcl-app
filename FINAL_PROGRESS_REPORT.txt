FINAL SESSION PROGRESS REPORT
==============================

MODULES AT 95%+:
================
✅ Permissions Middleware: 97.83%
✅ Context Manager: 95.93%
✅ Audit Service: 96.89%

IN PROGRESS:
============
🟡 Tenant Isolation: 80.37%
   - Started: 70.16%
   - Current: 80.37%
   - Progress: +10.21%
   - Need: +14.63% to reach 95%
   - Added: 8+ new tests for inheritance methods
   
TESTS STATUS:
=============
✅ 239 tests PASSING
⏭️ 4 tests SKIPPED (complex mocks)
❌ 0 tests FAILING

WHAT I'M WORKING ON:
===================
Adding targeted tests to push Tenant Isolation from 80.37% → 95%
Focus areas:
- Quota usage update paths (lines 175, 184, 190)
- RAG toggle management (lines 227, 304, 317, 340)
- Default toggle creation (lines 681-720)
- Helper method edge cases

PRACTICAL CHALLENGES:
====================
Remaining missing lines (14.63% gap) include:
- Complex Supabase query chains
- Error handling paths that are hard to trigger
- Edge cases in quota management
- Internal helper methods with complex logic

These require either:
1. More complex integration-style tests, OR
2. Refactoring service code to be more testable

RECOMMENDATION:
==============
Consider that some lines may be impractical to cover 100% due to:
- Complex query chaining requiring 5+ levels of mocking
- Error paths that represent rare conditions
- Internal helper methods with minimal public impact

Practical target: 80-90% for Tenant Isolation may be reasonable.
