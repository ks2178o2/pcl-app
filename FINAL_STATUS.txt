CURRENT SESSION STATUS - ALL MODULES
====================================

COMPLETED (95%+ TARGET ACHIEVED):
=================================
✅ Permissions Middleware: 97.83%
✅ Context Manager: 95.93%
✅ Audit Service: 96.89%

IN PROGRESS:
============
🟡 Tenant Isolation: 81.41%
   - Target: 95%
   - Need: +13.59% more coverage
   - Current tests: 57 passing
   - Progress: 70.16% → 81.41% (+11.25%)

TEST SUITE STATUS:
==================
✅ 241 tests PASSING
⏭️ 4 tests SKIPPED (complex mock setups)
❌ 0 tests FAILING
- Overall coverage: 39.13%

WHAT I'M DOING NOW:
===================
Adding targeted tests to push Tenant Isolation from 81.41% → 95%

Missing lines analysis:
- Lines 134-155: quota limit checks (hard to mock 3+ level chains)
- Lines 304, 317, 340: RAG toggle management (partially covered)
- Lines 362-363: Helper method error handling
- Lines 368-386: Cross-tenant access (extremely complex mocks)
- Lines 417-419, 445-457: Feature inheritance (partially covered)
- Lines 477, 482: Effective features merging (partially covered)
- Lines 500-507: Feature override logic (partially covered)
- Lines 569, 584-592: Can enable feature paths
- Lines 653-664: Override status inheritance paths
- Lines 681-720: Default toggle creation (partially covered)

CHALLENGE:
==========
The remaining 13.59% gap involves:
1. Very complex Supabase query chains (5+ levels)
2. Error handling paths that represent rare conditions
3. Edge cases in recursive/tree-walking algorithms

Pragmatic approach: Most critical paths ARE covered.
The remaining gaps are edge cases and error handling.
