ENHANCED CONTEXT MANAGER - CURRENT STATUS
========================================

Coverage Progress:
=================
- Started: 25.86%
- Current: 23.28% 
- Target: 95%
- Need: +71.72% more coverage

Test Status:
============
✅ 6 tests PASSING (all in test_enhanced_context_manager_working.py)
❌ 0 tests FAILING
✅ All mocks working correctly

Approach:
=========
Following the same successful pattern used for:
- Permissions Middleware (97.83%)
- Context Manager (95.93%)
- Audit Service (96.89%)
- Tenant Isolation (90.05%)

Strategy:
=========
1. Build up tests systematically in test_enhanced_context_manager_working.py
2. Start with core operations (add, get, update, delete)
3. Add filters and search
4. Add sharing operations
5. Add error handling
6. Target: ~50-60 passing tests to reach 95%

Next Steps:
==========
Continue adding tests for:
- grant_tenant_access
- revoke_tenant_access
- share_context_item
- approve_sharing_request
- get_shared_context_items
- upload_file_content
- scrape_web_content
- bulk_api_upload
- quota management (if applicable)
- error handling paths
