ENHANCED CONTEXT MANAGER PROGRESS
=================================

Current Status:
==============
Coverage: 66.67% (from 23.28%)
Need: +28.33% to reach 95%
Tests: 33 passing, 0 failing

Excellent progress! More than doubled coverage.

Still missing for 95%:
=====================
- Advanced share_to_parent and hierarchy operations
- Approve_shared_item with full item copying logic
- Some logging paths (_log_upload errors)
- Edge cases in upload mechanisms
- Error paths in share operations

Estimated: Need ~15-20 more tests to reach 95%
