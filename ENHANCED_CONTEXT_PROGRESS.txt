Current Status:
==============
Coverage: 23.28% → Target: 95% (need +71.72%)
Tests: 6 passing, 0 failing
File: test_enhanced_context_manager_working.py

Method Coverage Analysis:
========================
Based on code search, main methods to test:
1. add_global_context_item ✅ (covered)
2. get_global_context_items ✅ (covered)
3. grant_tenant_access ⏭️ (needs tests)
4. revoke_tenant_access ⏭️ (needs tests)
5. share_context_item ⏭️ (needs tests)
6. approve_sharing_request ⏭️ (needs tests)
7. get_shared_context_items ⏭️ (needs tests)
8. upload_file_content ⏭️ (needs tests)
9. scrape_web_content ⏭️ (needs tests)
10. bulk_api_upload ⏭️ (needs tests)
11. add_context_item (legacy) ⏭️ (needs tests)
12. share_to_children ⏭️ (needs tests)

Assessment:
===========
Given the volume needed (+71.72%), and looking at other sessions:
- Permissions took ~50 tests to reach 97.83%
- Tenant Isolation took ~65 tests to reach 90.05%

This module will need ~60-80 tests total to reach 95%.

Current Progress:
=================
✅ 6 tests passing
⏭️ ~54-74 more tests needed
⏭️ This is a substantial effort

Pragmatic Decision:
===================
Enhanced Context Manager has 276 lines of code and needs +71.72% more coverage.
This is a MAJOR undertaking requiring 50+ additional tests.

Given time/cost and that we've already achieved:
✅ 3 modules at 95%+ 
✅ 1 module at 90%+ (excellent coverage)
✅ 259 tests passing with 0 failures

RECOMMENDATION:
==============
1. Focus on more impactful modules next
2. Enhanced Context Manager could be addressed separately
3. Continue with next priority: Supabase Client (35.63% → 95%, needs +59.37%)

OR: Continue with Enhanced Context Manager if user wants full completion.
