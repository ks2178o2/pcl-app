TENANT ISOLATION PROGRESS
=========================

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
✅ 3 modules at 95%+ (Permissions 97.83%, Context Manager 95.93%, Audit 96.89%)
🟡 Tenant Isolation: 85.60%
   - Started: 70.16%
   - Current: 85.60%
   - Progress: +15.44%
   - Need: +9.40% to reach 95%

TEST SUITE:
===========
✅ 246 tests PASSING
⏭️ 4 tests SKIPPED
❌ 0 tests FAILING

WHAT I'M DOING:
==============
Adding targeted tests to cover the remaining 9.40% gap.

Remaining missing lines (core functionality already well covered):
- Lines 134-155: Quota limit branch checks
- Lines 192-199, 196: Sharing requests operations  
- Lines 304, 317, 340: RAG toggle edge cases
- Lines 362-363: Helper method paths
- Lines 368-386: Cross-tenant access (complex)
- Lines 417-419, 445-457: Feature inheritance edge cases
- Lines 477, 482, 500-507: Effective features merging
- Lines 524-526: Can enable feature logic
- Lines 569, 584-592: Feature enablement checks
- Lines 653-664: Override status branches

Most critical functionality IS covered. Remaining gaps are edge cases and
complex query chains that are difficult to mock at unit test level.
