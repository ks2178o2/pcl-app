# Manual End-to-End Test Instructions

## üéØ Objective

Test the complete workflow from new user signup ‚Üí patient creation ‚Üí call recording ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí follow-up plan with the new center-based hierarchy.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checks

Before starting, verify:
1. ‚úÖ Database migration complete
2. ‚úÖ RLS policies deployed (4 policies active)
3. ‚úÖ Application code deployed
4. ‚úÖ Supabase Edge Functions running

Run this first:
```sql
-- Verify system is ready
SELECT COUNT(*) as organization_count FROM organizations;
SELECT COUNT(*) as center_count FROM centers;
SELECT COUNT(*) as policy_count FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'patients';

-- Should see: 5 orgs, 3 centers, 4 policies
```

## üöÄ Test Execution

### Step 1: Create Test User (Admin Interface)

**Location**: Admin ‚Üí User Management

**Actions**:
1. Open admin panel
2. Navigate to "User Management" or "Create User"
3. Fill in:
   - **Email**: `test-salesperson@example.com`
   - **Password**: `Test123!@#`
   - **Name**: `Test Salesperson`
   - **Organization**: Select "Sales Pro Corp"
   - **Roles**: Check "salesperson"
   - **Centers**: Check "Sales Center A" (or any center)
4. Click "Create User"
5. ‚úÖ Verify success message

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.email,
    p.salesperson_name,
    ua.center_id,
    c.name as center_name
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_assignments ua ON ua.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN centers c ON ua.center_id = c.id
WHERE u.email = 'test-salesperson@example.com';
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ User exists in `auth.users`
- ‚úÖ Profile exists with `organization_id` set
- ‚úÖ User assignment exists with `center_id` set
- ‚úÖ Center matches selected center from UI

---

### Step 2: Log In as Test User

**Actions**:
1. Log out of admin account
2. Log in with:
   - Email: `test-salesperson@example.com`
   - Password: `Test123!@#`
3. ‚úÖ Verify login successful
4. ‚úÖ Verify you see only "Sales Center A" (or your assigned center)

**Expected Behavior**:
- No center selection modal (1 center assignment)
- Dashboard loads successfully
- No error messages

---

### Step 3: Create Test Patient

**Location**: Main Dashboard ‚Üí Patient Selection

**Actions**:
1. Click "+ New Patient" or search for patient
2. Fill in patient details:
   - **Name**: "Dr. Sarah Williams"
   - **Email**: "sarah.williams@email.com" (optional)
   - **Phone**: "555-1234" (optional)
3. Click "Create"
4. ‚úÖ Verify success message
5. ‚úÖ Verify patient appears in list

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.full_name,
    p.center_id,
    c.name as center_name,
    p.created_at
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN centers c ON p.center_id = c.id
WHERE p.full_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams';
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ `center_id` is **NOT NULL**
- ‚úÖ `center_id` matches user's assigned center
- ‚úÖ Patient visible in UI list

---

### Step 4: Start Call Recording

**Location**: Main Dashboard ‚Üí Professional Recording Tab

**Actions**:
1. Select patient "Dr. Sarah Williams"
2. Verify center is auto-selected
3. Click "Start Recording" or start microphone
4. Record for 10-15 seconds
5. Stop recording
6. ‚úÖ Verify recording saved
7. ‚úÖ Check dashboard for new call record

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
SELECT 
    cr.id,
    cr.customer_name,
    cr.center_id,
    cr.patient_id,
    cr.recording_complete,
    cr.transcript,
    c.name as center_name
FROM call_records cr
LEFT JOIN centers c ON cr.center_id = c.id
WHERE cr.customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
ORDER BY cr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ `center_id` is **NOT NULL** and matches patient's center
- ‚úÖ `patient_id` references the patient we created
- ‚úÖ `recording_complete` is `true`
- ‚úÖ Audio file uploaded to storage

---

### Step 5: Wait for Transcription & Analysis

**Actions**:
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for transcription to complete
2. Refresh page or check call records
3. ‚úÖ Verify transcript appears
4. Click on the call record to view details
5. ‚úÖ Verify analysis is generating or complete

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
-- Check transcription
SELECT 
    cr.id,
    cr.transcript,
    LENGTH(cr.transcript) as transcript_length,
    cr.transcript NOT LIKE '%Transcribing%' as transcription_complete
FROM call_records cr
WHERE cr.customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
ORDER BY cr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check analysis
SELECT 
    ca.id,
    ca.call_record_id,
    ca.summary,
    ca.model_used,
    ca.customer_personality,
    ca.created_at
FROM call_analysis ca
WHERE ca.call_record_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM call_records 
    WHERE customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
    ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
);
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Transcript is not blank or "Transcribing..."

2. Scroll to "Follow-Up Plan" section
3. Click "Generate Follow-Up Plan"
4. Wait for generation to complete
5. ‚úÖ Verify plan appears with recommendations

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
-- Check follow-up plan
SELECT 
    fup.id,
    fup.call_record_id,
    fup.strategy_type,
    fup.recommended_timing,
    fup.priority_score,
    fup.customer_urgency,
    fup.next_action,
    COUNT(fum.id) as message_count
FROM follow_up_plans fup
LEFT JOIN follow_up_messages fum ON fum.follow_up_plan_id = fup.id
WHERE fup.call_record_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM call_records 
    WHERE customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
    ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY fup.id
ORDER BY fup.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check messages
SELECT 
    fum.id,
    fum.channel_type,
    fum.message_content,
    fum.priority
FROM follow_up_messages fum
JOIN follow_up_plans fup ON fum.follow_up_plan_id = fup.id
WHERE fup.call_record_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM call_records 
    WHERE customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
    ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY fum.priority DESC;
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Follow-up plan exists

### Step 7: Verify RLS Security

**Actions**:
1. Create **second test user** in **different center**
2. Log in as second user
3. Try to search for "Dr. Sarah Williams"
4. ‚úÖ Verify patient is **NOT visible**

**SQL Verification**:
```sql
-- Check what first test user can see
-- (Run this in Supabase SQL Editor AS the test user)
SET local "request.jwt.claims" = '{"sub":"<FIRST_USER_ID>"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) as visible_patients, COUNT(DISTINCT center_id) as centers FROM patients;
-- Should see: 1 patient (Dr. Sarah Williams)

-- Check what second user can see  
SET local "request.jwt.claims" = '{"sub":"<SECOND_USER_ID>"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) as visible_patients, COUNT(DISTINCT center_id) as centers FROM patients;
-- Should see: 0 patients (different center)
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ First user sees their center's patients only
- ‚úÖ Second user sees different patients or none
- ‚úÖ No cross-center data leakage

---

## üìä Complete Journey Verification

Run this to see the entire data flow:

```sql
-- Complete journey check
SELECT 
    'User' as step,
    u.email as data_point,
    ua.center_id as center_id,
    c.name as center_name
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_assignments ua ON ua.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN centers c ON ua.center_id = c.id
WHERE u.email = 'test-salesperson@example.com'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Patient' as step,
    p.full_name as data_point,
    p.center_id as center_id,

FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN centers c ON p.center_id = c.id
WHERE p.full_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Call Record' as step,
    cr.customer_name as data_point,
    cr.center_id as center_id,
    c.name as center_name

ORDER BY step, data_point;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Patient not creating

**Check**:
```sql
-- Verify center assignment exists
SELECT * FROM user_assignments WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test-salesperson@example.com'
);
```

### Issue: Can't see patients after creation

**Check**:
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'patients';

-- Should see 4 policies
```

### Issue: Call analysis not generating

**Check**:
```sql
-- Check if transcript exists
SELECT id, transcript, LENGTH(transcript) 
FROM call_records 
WHERE customer_name = 'Dr. Sarah Williams'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- If transcript is complete, check edge function logs in Supabase
```
